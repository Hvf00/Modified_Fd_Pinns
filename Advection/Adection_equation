#Adection equation 

This repository implements **Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)** to solve the **advection equation**:  

∂u/∂t + c * ∂u/∂x = 0

The code supports flexible boundary conditions and enhanced training techniques for accurate solutions.  
Results are validated against CFD simulations.
