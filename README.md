# Modified_Fd_Pinns
This repository contains implementations of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) applied to benchmark fluid dynamics problems.
It supports enhanced training techniques such as Fourier feature layers and finite-difference gradients.
The code is designed for fast experimentation with boundary conditions and network architectures.
Results are validated against CFD simulations for accuracy and efficiency.
